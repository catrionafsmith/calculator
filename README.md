**Built with:** HTML, CSS and JS.

**What I have learned:** I learned how to link functions to buttons, and how to connect the overall logic for a calculator. I also learned how to use CSS grid to line up buttons within a container.

**What issues I faced and how I resolved them:** The logic behind calculations where a user enters multiple operators (e.g. 23 + 24 - 5), however I was able to solve this by using temporary variables to store the result of the first calculation.

**Source:** The idea for this project was from The Odin Project, along with initial guidance on which functions should be created first. Background image is from pngtree.com. README.md template is by skirianov.
